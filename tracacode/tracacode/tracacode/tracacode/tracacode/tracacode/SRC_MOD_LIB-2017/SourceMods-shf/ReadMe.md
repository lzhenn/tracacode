Remove the vertical diffusion (turbulance) caused heating to the atmosphere over the Tibetan Platau. This process can be treated as, instead of redistributing the surface heating, the turbulance eats up all surface heating like a black hole. Therefore, this is nearly shutdown the surface heating by the TP.
